## Core Concept: The Listener Profile
Every person has a unique "listener profile" — a neurological fingerprint of musical preference based on how your brain responds to 7 dimensions of any song. You don't need to be a musician to be deeply musical.

## The 7 Dimensions of Music

### Musical Dimensions (the sound itself)

| Dimension | Spectrum | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Melody** | Narrow/stepwise ↔ Wide/leaping | The emotional carrier — how intervals and contour transmit feeling |
| **Lyrics** | Conversational/relatable ↔ Abstruse/enigmatic | The mind of a record — ideas expressed through words |
| **Rhythm** | Straight ↔ Syncopated | The hips of music — the irresistible urge to move |
| **Timbre** | Acoustic ↔ Electronic | The sonic portrait — tone color that distinguishes instruments and voices |

### Aesthetic Dimensions (how it's presented)

| Dimension | Spectrum | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Authenticity** | Cerebral (above the neck) ↔ Visceral (below the neck) | How genuine and sincere the music feels — head vs. heart vs. hips |
| **Realism** | Realistic (actual instruments) ↔ Abstract (virtual/synthesized) | Can you picture the instruments? Or do they exist only in code? |
| **Novelty** | Familiar/comfortable ↔ Innovative/challenging | Preference for known forms vs. being pushed by originality |

## Chapter Structure
1. **Chapters 1-7:** One chapter per dimension (deep dive with artist examples)
2. **Chapter 8:** Form and Function
3. **Chapter 9:** Falling in Love (with music)
4. **Coda:** Concluding reflections

## Artists Referenced
Prince, Frank Sinatra, Lana Del Rey, Kanye West, Barenaked Ladies, and many others — each illustrating different listener profile dimensions.

## Interactive Features on Website
- **Record Pull:** Community feature to share and discover music
- **Virtual Jukeboxes:** Songs organized by chapter/dimension
- **Listener Profile exploration tools**

## Relevance to Geeky Punks Projects

### Web Modules / Interactive Pages
The 7 dimensions map directly to interactive audio experiences:

1. **Timbre Explorer** — let users morph between acoustic and electronic timbres (directly relevant to synthesis courses)
2. **Rhythm Lab** — straight vs. syncopated beat patterns with the Bullfrog
3. **Melody Playground** — stepwise vs. leaping interval experiments
4. **Realism Slider** — blend between realistic instruments and abstract synthesis
5. **Novelty Generator** — familiar patterns vs. algorithmic/generative music
6. **Listener Profile Quiz** — interactive tool where visitors discover their musical identity

### Course Integration ("El Sonido del Todo")
Each dimension could be a module/week in the synthesis course:
- Week on Timbre → oscillator types, filters, waveshaping
- Week on Rhythm → sequencing, clock division, swing
- Week on Melody → pitch CV, quantizers, arpeggiators
- Week on Realism → sampling vs. synthesis, physical modeling
- Week on Novelty → generative patches, randomness, chaos
- Week on Authenticity → expression, performance, human feel
- Week on Lyrics → vocoding, speech synthesis, sound design for voice

### Brand Alignment
Susan Rogers' journey (listener → engineer → neuroscientist) mirrors the Geeky Punks ethos: you don't need to be a musician to explore sound. The "listener profile" concept validates that everyone's relationship with sound is valid and unique.
